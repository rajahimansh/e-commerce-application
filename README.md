E-Commerce Microservices Application
Project Overview
  This project implements a microservices-based e-commerce application focusing on user authentication, product management, and order processing. It's designed with Python Flask, emphasizing concurrency control, high availability through clustering, and secure API communication.

1. Microservices Architecture Design
  User Authentication Service: Manages user sign-up, login, and authentication processes.
  Product Management Service: Handles CRUD operations on products, with a focus on concurrency control.
  Order Processing Service: Manages the lifecycle of orders from creation to completion.
  Technology Stack: Given the preference for Python, Flask is a lightweight choice that's well-suited for microservices. Flask's simplicity allows for rapid development and easy deployment of RESTful APIs.

2. Concurrency Control
  In the Product Management Service, use optimistic locking for concurrency control. This involves adding a version number to product records. When updating a record, check that the version hasn't changed since it was read. If it has, the update is rejected.
  Implement this logic using Python functions, possibly as lambda functions where simple, concise logic is required, for clearer and more maintainable code.
3. Clustering and High Availability
  Employ Docker for containerization of each microservice for isolation and ease of deployment.
  Utilize Kubernetes for orchestrating these containers, ensuring that the system scales properly under load and remains highly available.
  Implement a load balancer (like Nginx) to distribute incoming requests evenly across your service instances.
4. Database Integration
  Depending on your requirements, choose between PostgreSQL (for relational data) or MongoDB (for document-oriented data).
  In Flask, use SQLAlchemy for SQL databases or Flask-PyMongo for MongoDB. Both libraries support pooling and efficient database operations.
  Structure your database schemas to support the entities in your application: users, products, and orders.
5. APIs and Communication
  Create RESTful APIs for your services using Flask. Secure these with API keys to ensure only authorized access.
  For each sensitive endpoint, require an API key in the request header and validate this before processing the request.
  For service-to-service communication, consider securing internal APIs with internal API keys or mutual TLS for added security.
6. Authentication and Authorization
Implement JWT-based authentication to manage user sessions securely. Python's PyJWT library can handle JWT creation and verification.
Ensure that API keys are used for both external access to your APIs and for service-to-service calls within your infrastructure. This adds an extra layer of security by verifying both the source of a request and its authentication status.
General Requirements
  Code Quality: Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code. Ensure your code is clean, and well-documented.
  Version Control: Use Git. Make your code repository available on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.
  Error Handling and Logging: Flask applications can use Pythonâ€™s built-in logging module for application logs. Ensure comprehensive error handling across all services.
  Testing: Utilize pytest for writing tests for your Flask applications, focusing on both unit and integration tests.
  Deployment: Your README should include Dockerfile examples for containerization and instructions for deploying with Docker Compose locally. For cloud deployments, provide guidance on deploying to platforms like AWS ECS or Google Kubernetes Engine.
  Bonus Features
  Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting in Flask using extensions like Flask-Limiter to protect your APIs from abuse.
  Asynchronous Communication: Use RabbitMQ or Redis as a message broker for decoupling services. This is particularly useful for order processing and notifications.
  Caching: Integrate Redis or Memcached to cache frequent queries or results, significantly improving response times.
  Monitoring and Alerting: Incorporate Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. Ensure your system is set up to alert on critical issues.
